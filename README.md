# INFR3110-A1

Description: As a member of Atlas X Games, our GDW project is not wholly suitable to a level editor, hence the creation of this basic platformer, containing a playable character and objects to be traversed

Focus: Of the given object I chose to focus on scripts, each object has a script where appropriate

Controls: Use A & D to move Left and Right, and the Space Bar to jump

Credits: The Move Script has basis in Lab #2 of this course (INFR 3110 Game Engine Design & Implementation). Creation of other scripts and additions to existing ones are mine alone.
